This project documents the laboratory activities carried out during the past
six months at the Intelligent Robotics Lab. This activity had as its objective the
development of an assistive robotic system guided by voice command and computer vision
artificial vision that would hand objects to bedridden patients in hospital or
home. Such a system was implemented in simulation using
CoppeliaSim, using ad-hoc libraries for the Implementation of voice control
and object detection, obtaining very satisfactory results that serve as a
basis for the development of the real system
